            </kbd></h4>

        <p class="text-muted text-left">We look at kids as our own. A belief to change the modern-day scenario of bland bookish education of some CBSE schools in Jaipur into a wholesome experience of moral and innate character development is what fuels the JPHS family.  To get a result and earn accolades in not the  goal but to enlighten young minds and to embark them on a journey of which there is no end-"the road to excellence" is. An expression reiterated at times innumerable by the director - "Aap hai toh hum hai" makes the facilitators push beyond their physical limits to keep up the pledge of devoted service towards the students and to make them the worthy citizens this country deserves. It is etched into the teaching style of each teacher to account for each student in the class and give individual attention for which a healthy teacher-student ratio of (1:8) is maintained. We, at JPHS, want to create coherent spirits and help students establish a mindful control over their body. We aim to sharpen their potentials into shearing swords that uphold the crest of JPHS high..</p>

                Nelson Mandela once said “Education is the most powerful weapon to change the world” and it still rings so true for our time and generation. With ever increasing uncertainty of what future holds in terms of career and employment opportunities, it has indeed become necessary to educate a child not only in what we know but equip him/her with the necessary skills for acquiring knowledge for the future. And to that effect our classroom instructions are designed to facilitate active learning by enabling flipped classrooms, research based projects etc in order to develop critical & creative thinking, soft skills, ICT skills and leadership skills in the students. And by doing so the children are not just equipped to take jobs but to create one even as they go about solving the problems of humanity through their ingenuity. The hallways and classrooms of Jayshree Periwal High School reverberate with this philosophy of our visionary leader Dr. Jayshree Periwal Ma’am, which drives every teaching and learning activity within the school. Over the past many years we have created a niche for ourselves by treading a path no one else has discovered. And this journey would have been impossible without the able support of the parents to this enduring vision. We are committed to serve the children by helping them become leaders so that they may lead us into a brighter future where truth, life and light fill the spaces.
